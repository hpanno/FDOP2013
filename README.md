<hr> This analysis can not be completed on SIGS. This has to be done on each weather station. 
<br>
<br>--For Wind Speed and Relative Humidity Graphs--
<br>1. Set annual filter to April 1-June 30. 
<br>2. Weather > Dinurla Graphs> Select 'Wind Speed' and 'Relative Humidity' from the Varialble options> 'OK'
<br>3. Capture and save graphics.

  <br>-Large Fires: 8
  <br>-MultiFire Days: 3
  <br>-Fire Cause: All

  <br>-Check the box for 'Conditional Probability Analysis - FireDays Only
  <br>-Analysis Variable: (Run this Analysis twice for each variable)
    <br>-Wind Speed
    <br>-Relative Humidity
  <br>-'OK'
<br>2. Select the 'Fires Probability Analysis' Window > Select 'View'> 'Decision Points'> Delete 3 class rows (should only work with 2 classes) 
  <br>-When setting thresholds for Wind Speed Class 1 will be '0' and Class 2 is the threshold left to discretion. 
  <br>-When setting threshold for Relative Humidity Class 1 will be the threshol left to disretion and Class 2 will be '0.
    The point at which decisions are made should be placed at points where fire days, multi fire days, and large fire days     begin to occur.
